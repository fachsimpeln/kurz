Open-Source URL-Shortener

A URL Shortener shortens a long URL, such as a link to a DropBox file, to a much shorter one. This URL Shortener can be installed on any web server with PHP. 

## Installation
To install, simply clone the repo and save the files in the web directory. Now only the links have to be changed (\<URL\>) and the 2 different tokens have to be entered (\<TOKEN\>, \<DEL_TOKEN\>).
Furthermore the ReCAPTCHA Secret has to be entered in the create/index.php in PHP and the ReCAPTCHA Site Key in JavaScript.
Don't forget to change the \<URL\> in the .htaccess file in the root directory.

## Live Demo
A live version of the project can be found at http://azeo.eu/s

## Have fun!
